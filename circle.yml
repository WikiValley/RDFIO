# The circle.yml file has seven primary sections. Each section represents a
# phase of the Build-Test-Deploy process:
#
# - machine: adjust the behavior of the virtual machine (VM)
# - checkout: checkout and clone code from a repository
# - dependencies: install your project’s language-specific dependencies
# - database: prepare a database for tests
# - compile: compile your project
# - test: run your tests
# - deployment: deploy your code to your web servers
#
# You can specify when to run custom commands relative to CircleCI’s inferred
# commands using three special keys:
#
# pre: run before inferred commands
# override: run instead of inferred commands
# post: run after inferred commands
#
# Modifiers
#
# You can tweak individual commands by adding a modifier. Allowed modifiers are:
#
# - timeout: if a command runs this many seconds without output, kill it
# (default:600s)
#
# - pwd: run commands using this value as the current working directory (default:
# the checkout directory named for your project, except in the machine and
# checkout/pre sections, where it defaults to $HOME.)
#
# - environment: a hash creating a list of environment variables set for this
# command (see Machine configuration for this modifier’s properties when used
# in the machine section of the file)
#
# - parallel: (only used with commands in the test section) if you have manually
# set up parallelism, set this to true to run a command across all VMs
#
# - files: The files identified by the file list (or globs) will be appended to
# the command arguments. The files will be distributed across all containers
# running the build. Check manual parallelism setup document for more details.
#
# - background: when “true”, runs a command in the background. It is similar to
# ending a shell command with ‘&’, but works correctly over ssh. Useful for
# starting servers, which your tests will connect to.
